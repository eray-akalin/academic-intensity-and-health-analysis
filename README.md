## Motivation  
I wonder how my daily habits change as academic workload increases. Hence, I decided to examine my physical health data to observe alterations induced by increasing academic intensity. I intend to analyze my health data across three time periods—Prep School, Freshman, Sophomore—representing increases in academic workload, respectively. By investigating trends and patterns, I hope to uncover how different academic schedules correlate with various physical health metrics.

## Dataset  

### Source  
- Data collected from my personal health metrics, such as step count, flights climbed, and energy burned.

### Description  
- Data is imported from the Apple Health application in XML format.  
- The dataset includes time-sensitive health metrics related to different activities.  
- The data spans multiple timelines correlating with varying academic intensities, enabling detailed analysis of the relationship between health data and academic workload.

### Time Periods  
- Preparatory School  
- Freshman Year  
- Sophomore Year

## Project Idea  
- Analyze how increasing academic intensity affects my physical activity and energy expenditure.  
- Determine trends and correlations in the data.

## Project Plan  

### Preprocessing Data  
- Import and clean the raw data.  
- Identify related and unrelated parts.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Determine trends and correlations using visualization techniques.  
- Utilize box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and linear regression models to identify patterns and relationships in the data.  

### Comparative Analysis  
- Compare changes in the data with respect to different timelines.  

### Results and Inferences  
- Come up with conclusions, propose improvements, and indicate drawbacks based on findings.  

### Presentation  
- Make a report summarizing findings, inferences, and methodologies used.

## Findings  
I learned that my physical activity tends to decrease as academic intensity increases. Additionally, I observed that seasonal changes significantly impact my physical activity levels. This project taught me a great deal about my physical habits, and I will certainly use these insights to shape my future lifestyle.

## Limitations  
A dataset from an Apple Watch would likely provide more accurate data, as I do not always have my phone with me. Additionally, metrics such as standing time or more precise active energy measurements would significantly enhance the scope of this project.

## Future Work  
Upon graduation, I expect to have a more extensive database, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate analysis as more data accumulates. Collaborative analysis, incorporating data from peers, could also yield more insightful and robust outcomes.
