# Health Data and Academic Intensity Analysis

## Dataset
**Source:** 
- Data collected from my personal health metrics such as step count, flights climbed, energy burned.  
  
**Description:**
- Data will be imported from Apple Health application in XML format.
- Data includes time-sensitive health data related to different metrics. 
- The data spans multiple timelines correlating with varying academic intensities, enabling detailed analysis of the relationship between health data and academic intensity.  

**Time Periods:**
- My preparatory school period
- My freshman year
- My sophomore year
In which academic workload increases respectively.

## Project Idea

- Analyze how increasing academic intensity affects my physical activity and energy expenditure.
- Determine trends and correlations in the data.

## Project Plan

**Preprocessing Data:** 
- Import and clean the raw data.
- Identify related and unrelated parts.  

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** 
- Determine trends and correlations using visualization techniques.
- Specify patterns.  

**Comparative Analysis:**
- Compare changes in the data with respect to different timelines.  

**Results and Inferences:** 
- Come up with conclusions, propose improvements and indicate drawbacks based on findings.  

**Presentation:** 
- Make a report summarizing findings, inferences and methodologies used.
